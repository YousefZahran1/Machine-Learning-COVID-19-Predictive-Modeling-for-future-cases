Ten Machine Learning COVID-19 Predictive Modeling for future cases

The COVID-19 pandemic has been the single most significant challenge worldwide, covering public health, economies, and day-to-day life. For effective planning in public health and resource allocation, one central aspect is the accurate prediction of COVID-19 cases and related outcomes. Machine learning and deep learning models can be effectively used to conduct predictive modeling. These models are capable of handling vast volumes of data, discovering hidden patterns, and predicting accurately to manage pandemics like COVID-19.

Predictive modeling for COVID-19 is essential for a variety of reasons. First, predictive models achieve optimum distribution and utilization of medical resources by projecting hospital beds, ventilators, and other critical supplies that will be required. Second, the predictions exhibit accurate projections on what might happen under different interventions, thus making the policymakers well-equipped in their decisions. Third, this prediction about the virus spread can raise awareness and improve compliance with health guidelines. Last but not least, knowledge of the future trajectories of the pandemic significantly mitigates economic disruptions by planning appropriate economic relief measures.

Notably, newly developed state-of-the-art methods have been proposed in modeling COVID-19 predictive studies. On the side of classification and regression, decision trees and random forests model complex interactions between variables and return very interpretable results. Gradient Boosting Machines like XGBoost are applied because of their high accuracy on different data types and robust behavior. Traditional logistic regression remains a staple for binary classification problems, often providing a baseline against which to compare more complex models. Long Short-Term Memory tops the list in time series prediction since this type of recurrent neural network is designed to pick up very long-term dependencies. In the domain of time series forecasting, statistical models like ARIMA and SARIMA are applied. Hybrid techniques that combine different ML and DL methods, for example, hybrid CNN-DT—Convolutional Neural Network and Decision Tree—are at the forefront of applications because they bank on the strengths of each of the techniques.
